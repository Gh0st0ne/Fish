#  Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.


## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community discord:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 
 * Any inappropriate material or behaviour.
 
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.
 
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 
 * Sustained disruption or trolling our online chats or events.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at our [online discord community](https://discord.gg/xWHKmpwhD9 "discord community"). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.


## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible at our [online community discord server.](https://discord.gg/xWHKmpwhD9 "online community discord server.")

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify aarav2you in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/xWHKmpwhD9 "discord server") with a concise description of your grievance.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
