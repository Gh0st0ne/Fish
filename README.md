## About
Fish is a phishing tool that inhabits a collection of webpages *(currently only Outlook)*. It tries to replicate webpages as closely as possible for a hard to distinguish phishing page.
## Features
#### Outlook
- Up-to-date outlook phishing page.
- Easily configurable, with a startup script.
- Has a menu that can be used to select the up-coming options (with color!).
- Can use any domain including but not limited to `Ngrok`, `Freenom`, `GoDaddy` etc.
- Has built-in option to install and use ngrok for a free public domain.
- Uses flask. Has options in the start-up script to configure the host and port.

## Installation

`$ git clone https://github.com/aarav2you/Fish.git`


------------

#### Go into the repo:
`$ cd Fish/`

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

`$ python fish.py`

## Great! How do I use it?
You can specify the values it asks for when executing the `app.py`. Leaving the settings on default is the best option (just press ⏎). Refer to the table below for all values:

| `Enter redirect URL` | The link it will redirect the victim to after credentials have been logged in `credentials.log`. `Default: https://www.office.com/?auth=2` 	|
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Flask server host`  | The local IP your flask server will run on. `Default: 127.0.0.1`                                                                    |
| `Flask server port`  | The port your flask server will run on. `Default: 80`                                                                               |
| `Use ngrok`          | This uses `nGrok`to to forward the phishing page to a public domain. More on this [here][1]. `Default: n`                           |
