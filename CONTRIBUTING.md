# Contributing to [Fish](https://github.com/aarav2you/Fish)
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- [Reporting a bug](https://github.com/aarav2you/Fish/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)
- [Discussing the current state of the code](https://github.com/aarav2you/Fish/discussions)
- [Submitting a fix](https://github.com/aarav2you/Fish/pulls)

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request from your `fork` â†’ `dev`!


## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/aarav2you/Fish/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) with the bug tempelate; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What actually happens
- Your operating system
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
